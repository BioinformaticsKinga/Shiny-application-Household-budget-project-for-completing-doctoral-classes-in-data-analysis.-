# Shiny application Household budget
It is project for completing doctoral classes in data analysis. 

The Shiny application is designed for managing a household budget. It allows users to add expenses, which are then assigned to a selected category, such as bills, food, or transportation.

The application includes a form where users enter the expense amount and select a date. Once an expense is added, the data is stored and visualized through charts. The application generates graphs that illustrate the daily distribution of expenses and the breakdown of expenses by category. This makes it easy to see where money is being spent and which categories have the highest expenditures.

Additionally, the application calculates the total sum of all expenses and displays a financial summary. If an incorrect amount is entered, the application shows an error message.
